# Fast-Food-Analysis

Note: Used a dataset that is not necessarily accurate/real. 


Description of data visualization. 

This visualization is a measure of the underrepresentation of that restaraunt in that state in comparison to that restaruant in the entire country. A higher value in the y-axis represent a greater underrepresentation of that restaraunt. A positive value is underrepresentation, and a negative value is overrepresentation. I took the top 8, which are all positive values(and hence the most underrepresented). First, I took the proportion of every fast food restaraunt with all of the restaurants in the USA (# restaurant in USA/all restaurant in USA). Then I took the proportion of every fast food restaraunts with all of the restaurants in each state (# restaurant in state/all restaurant in state). Then the difference between the country percentage and the state percentage gives us the "percentage diff" we used as the y-axis in the plot. If the difference is large, that means that the proportion of all mcdonalds in USA is far off and much greater than the mcdonalds proportion in that state, meaning that it is very underrepresented. Hence, it would have less competition in that state, and more of a reason for it to represent itself in the given state, since the fame and name of the brand is higher at the country level, and the demand for it is higher in the state. 

The conclusion that I came up with is that Mcdonalds in Hawaii is the most underepresented restaurant since the difference is the largest, and that it would be the ideal place according to this plot.


My visualization would have been better with more data points. But since the naming system on the x-axis was very long, I had to filter it down and only show the top 8. If I could make each name fall vertical on the x-axis, I could include all of the points, and have a clearer visualization.
